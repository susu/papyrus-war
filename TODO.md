TODO
====

Version targets:
================

## v0.0.1 target:
  - limited size of water surface
  - one white paper boat
  - the ship can be controlled by mouse-right click
  - surface is scrollable

## v0.0.2 target:
  - ship is loaded from file (.obj or COLLADA format)


TODO list
=========

Always a good idea to ``ack --cpp TODO`` or ``grep -nrs TODO``

 * ENFORCE idiom
 * include __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ to logs
 * Wrapper class for GLFW (at least some RAII wrapper for init-terminate)

## broken down sub-tasks for v0.0.1:

  * show a blue surface (Surface class)
  * show a white ship (PaperBoat class)
